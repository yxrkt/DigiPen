
Unzip all files to the same directory and press F5 from the 
MatLab text editor to get the feature vecs. They are called
fVecA, fVecB, and fVecC, respectively.

These are already saved and divided appropriately into the 
training, target, and test vectors for each class. All of 
the data, including the network itself, is saved into 
nnet.mat. Pieces can be manually loaded one by one, if 
desired.
