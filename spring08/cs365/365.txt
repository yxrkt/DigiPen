The Adapter Design Pattern
- more commonly known as wrapper code
- not to be confused with bridge
  - bridge good for one interface over multiple APIs ( ex: opengl and direct3d )
  - adapter mainly an abstraction over adaptee ( or adaptees )
- two types of adapters
  - object adapter
    - show wikipedia diagram
    - traditionally contains instance of adaptee class
    - stl containers
      - .empty(), .size()
  - class adapter
    - show wikipedia diagram
    - often involves multiple inheritance
    - show wiipedia java example
    - stl containers
      - std::stack, std::queue
- examples of adapters in game development
  - components ( object )
    - wrap engine's classes
    - 'walk' component wraps physics and sound: move and play footstep noise
