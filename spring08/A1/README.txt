CS 370 Assignment 1

Note: This was built off the image tutorial; it still carries
      the name in some places.

Usage:
------

<Part 1>

- No image is initially loaded. Use the 'Load Bitmap' button
  to find and open a 24 bit bitmap. Several examples are
  included in the same directory as the solution.

- By default, clicking on one of the five resolution buttons
  will change the source image and displayed image (but not 
  the original cached image loaded from file). To scale only 
  the source or displayed image, select either 'source' or
  'destination' under the resolution buttons.

- Clicking on the picture area after a bitmap has been 
  loaded will change the display to the source image.

- The resolutions for the source and displayed images are 
  shown in the status bar at the bottom of the window.

<Part 2>

- Adjust the threshold as desired using the threshold 
  slider. The default is set to 195. This will exclude one 
  of the shapes in the 'shapes.bmp' sample bitmap.

- Clicking 'Apply' will by default change the displayed 
  image to a black and white polar representation. Setting 
  the threshold before using this button will give 
  different results.

- To determine the number of objects and display each one 
  with its own unique color, first select the 'Objects' 
  option before clicking 'Apply.' The number of objects 
  will be displayed in the status bar, next to the image 
  resolutions.

- Clicking 'Apply' will not change the source image. 

Note: The 'solid.bmp' image shows a good example of 6-pixel 
      connectivity.
