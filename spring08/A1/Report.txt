Assignment 1



    The assignment went fairly smooth. Among the greatest 
burdens was learning C#. While a lot of things in C# are 
extremely convenient (namely designing the interface), 
there were times where a simple memcpy would have saved a
lot of trouble. I ended up editing the RGB values 
independently. Using .Width or .Height was also slowing 
down the Part 1 implementation drastically. I didn't know 
C# had functions without the traditional parenthesis 
operator. Storing the returned values as variables 
solved.

    The only problem with the actual implementation I had 
was the update function. Writing the function was simple 
enough, but it took a while before I came to realize it 
was necessary.
